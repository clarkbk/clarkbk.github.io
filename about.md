## Life

I narrowly missed being born in North Carolina, where most of my family lives, and instead grew up in Atlanta with a sister named [Rachel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2717269). After a lifetime as an overprivileged and under-aware prep star at Pace Academy, I went to Vanderbilt University, where I did Economics, Chinese, Frisbee, and other general shenanigans. For a semester, I lived in Beijing. After school, I moved to New York to take my first job at Yelp. Later I moved to Phoenix, still with Yelp. Then back to NYC for a new job and with my girlfriend (now wife) [Janice](https://www.facebook.com/janice.bacuetes), with whom I now reside contentedly in South Williamsburg, on the East River.

* a dog walker

## This Site

I made this website. You can fork it, star it, or just plain poke around it [on GitHub](https://github.com/clarkbk/clarkbk.github.io). Here are some of the things that I used:

* [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) for domain registration
* [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for fast, free DNS
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for simple, free web hosting
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for easy templating and markdown things
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) and [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) themes from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) for "visually enhancing my personal brand"
* [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) for the slideshow up there
