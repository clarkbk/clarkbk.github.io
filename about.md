## Life

I narrowly missed being born in North Carolina, where most of my family lives, and instead grew up in Atlanta with a sister named [Rachel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2717269). After a lifetime as an overprivileged and under-aware prep star at Pace Academy, I went to Vanderbilt University, where I did Economics, Chinese, Frisbee, and other general shenanigans. For a semester, I lived in Beijing. After school, I moved to New York to take my first job at Yelp. Later I moved to Phoenix, still with Yelp. Then back to NYC for a new job and with my girlfriend [Janice](https://www.facebook.com/janice.bacuetes) (*juh-neece*), with whom I now reside contently in South Williamsburg, on the East River.

**Fun facts:**

* never owned an iPhone
* lives in Brooklyn, rides a fixed gear bicycle, and so what
* used to speak pretty good Mandarin Chinese
* proficient with banjos and some other things
* have been to Disneyland (twice), not Disneyworld
* can't understand why anyone likes baseball
* had a college radio show and played [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U55hXetSKSQ) weirdly often
* random celebrity sighting: <span id="celeb_sighting">Alec Baldwin</span>

## Work

I've worked at:

* [SeatGeek](https://seatgeek.com/), as Director of Customer Acquisition
* [Buddy Media](http://www.exacttarget.com/products/social-media-marketing/buddy-media) (now part of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud), as a Business Intelligence Analyst
* [Clover](https://www.clover.com/), as a Sales Operations Manager
* [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/nyc), as a CRM Administrator

These jobs didn't make my [résumé (pdf)]() or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkbk), but I have also at various times earned a living as:

* a dog walker
* a grocery bagger
* a Methodist wedding acolyte

## Pictures and Links

Maybe I will put a photo gallery here!

In the meantime, I put my photos mostly [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/photos/101356415299525876294/albums), of all places.
